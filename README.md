# WebAPI
This project has been created using .Net 7, Entity Framework Core ORM, PostgreSQL database according to a test task given to me by *Undisclosed Company*.

Not all decisions in the solution are made according to the given API just for the purpose of an example that there are many possible ways to solve a problem.

Some code has been added only for further development and also as an example.

Please fill in your credentials for the database, try the API, and look to the controllers code to read the comments.

Use for it code from the *master* branch.

API with Swagger UI has been published using Azure CI/CD pipelines using Azure web service app with Postgres flexible database on https://nodesapi.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html
